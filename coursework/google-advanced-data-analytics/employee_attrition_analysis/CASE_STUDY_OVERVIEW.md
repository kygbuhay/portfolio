# Employee Attrition Analysis — Visual Workflow Overview

***From business question to actionable insights: A comprehensive 7-stage analytical methodology***

---

## 🎯 **Business Challenge**

> *"Why are employees leaving, and what can we do to reduce attrition?"*
> — Salifort Motors Leadership

**The Stakes:** High employee turnover costs organizations 50-200% of an employee's annual salary in recruitment, training, and productivity loss.

## 🔍 **Key Discoveries**

### **Primary Finding: Satisfaction is King**
```
Satisfaction Level Impact:
├── Low (≤0.4)    → 92% attrition rate
├── Medium (0.4-0.7) → 15% attrition rate
└── High (≥0.7)   → 8% attrition rate
```

### **Secondary Patterns**
- **Tenure Risk**: 60% of leavers have ≤3 years experience
- **Workload Stress**: 7+ projects correlate with 45% attrition
- **Department Gaps**: Sales (28% attrition) vs R&D (12% attrition)

## 🏆 **Model Performance Journey**

| Stage | Model | ROC-AUC | Recall | Key Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Baseline** | Logistic Regression | 0.837 | 0.805 | Satisfaction dominates coefficients |
| **Advanced** | Random Forest | **0.991** | **0.923** | Non-linear patterns captured |
| **Champion** | Random Forest (Tuned) | **0.991** | **0.923** | Production-ready performance |

**Business Translation:** *Model identifies 92% of at-risk employees, enabling proactive intervention*

## 💼 **Stakeholder Impact**

### **For HR Leadership**
- **Risk Identification**: Flag at-risk employees before departure decisions
- **Policy Guidance**: Focus retention efforts on satisfaction and workload management
- **ROI Quantification**: Prevent $50K-$150K per avoided departure

### **For Department Managers**
- **Early Warning System**: Monthly model scores for team members
- **Coaching Priorities**: Address satisfaction and project load imbalances
- **Resource Allocation**: Target support for high-risk departments (Sales/Support)

### **For Executives**
- **Strategic Insights**: Satisfaction drives retention more than compensation
- **Competitive Advantage**: Proactive retention vs. reactive hiring
- **Ethical AI**: Responsible deployment with bias monitoring safeguards
