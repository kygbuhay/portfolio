# Reports

GitHub-friendly exports of the analysis notebooks, with supporting figures.

## Structure
- notebooks_md/ — Markdown exports of each Jupyter notebook (02 → 06).
- figures/ — Image assets organized by notebook (e.g., figures_06_final_recommendation/).

## Usage
- Open the `.md` reports directly on GitHub to review the analysis without running notebooks.
- Figures are referenced via relative paths and should render in GitHub once committed.
