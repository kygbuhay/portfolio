## 📊 Executive Summary
Analysis of one year of Google Fiber customer support data across three markets revealed a **21.4% repeat call rate (RCR)** — meaning roughly 1 in 5 customers called back within seven days for the same issue.  
**Market 3** consistently showed **2× higher RCR** than other regions, primarily driven by **Internet/WiFi (Type 5)** and **TV Connectivity (Type 3)** issues. Following workflow changes in February, RCR declined by ~5 percentage points, suggesting measurable gains in first-contact resolution (FCR).

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Finding #1: Market 3 repeat-call concentration  
**Observation:** Market 3’s RCR averaged **34% vs 16–18%** in Markets 1–2.  
- Issue Types 5 and 3 represented ~60% of repeat calls.  
- The pattern persisted across all months before April.  
**Why it matters:** Market 3 accounts for nearly half of total repeat volume, dragging down the company-wide FCR.  
**Root-cause hypothesis:** Staffing shortages and inconsistent troubleshooting protocols in the regional contact center.

---

### Finding #2: Issue Type 5 (Internet/WiFi) drives 40% of repeats  
**Observation:** Customers reporting WiFi or connectivity issues were **1.8× more likely** to call again within seven days.  
**Why it matters:** Suggests gaps in script accuracy or self-service guidance.  
**Root-cause hypothesis:** Agents may escalate too late or rely on outdated modem-reset instructions.

---

### Finding #3: Seasonal improvement post-process change  
**Observation:** February showed a **5 pp drop** in RCR across all markets, maintained through Q2.  
**Why it matters:** Indicates that the new troubleshooting workflow or QA program launched that month had measurable impact.  
**Root-cause hypothesis:** Adoption of new scripts and refresher training improved first-call resolutions.

---

### Finding #4: Market 1 demonstrates strong operational discipline  
**Observation:** Market 1 maintained **FCR ≈ 86%** with stable call volume throughout the year.  
**Why it matters:** Serves as an internal best-practice benchmark — potential template for scaling to other markets.

---

### Finding #5: Short-term repeat window  
**Observation:** **67% of repeat calls occur within 3 days** of the initial contact.  
**Why it matters:** Suggests many issues are unresolved rather than new, validating the need for same-day or next-day follow-up protocols.

## 💡 Business Recommendations

### Priority 1: Standardize Market 3 troubleshooting & QA  
- **What:** Audit agent scripts, call recordings, and escalation paths for Internet/WiFi and TV Connectivity issues.  
- **Why:** These two categories generate most of Market 3’s excess repeat volume.  
- **Expected impact:** Reduce Market 3 RCR by 5–10 pp, improving total FCR by ~3 pp.  
- **Effort:** Medium **Owner:** Regional Ops Manager  

---

### Priority 2: Implement early follow-up callback workflow  
- **What:** Proactively contact customers within 48 hours of high-risk issue types.  
- **Why:** 2/3 of repeat calls happen within 3 days — intervening early could resolve them.  
- **Expected impact:** 5–7 pp reduction in repeat volume.  
- **Effort:** Low **Owner:** Customer Success Team  

---

### Priority 3: Expand Market 1 practices company-wide  
- **What:** Replicate Market 1’s agent QA checklist and peer-review system.  
- **Why:** Proven correlation with higher FCR and lower variability.  
- **Expected impact:** Sustainable ≥ 85% FCR across regions.  
- **Effort:** Medium **Owner:** Training & Quality Assurance

## 📝 Analysis Notes
**Limitations:**  
- Some daily data gaps in January/April → weekly aggregation used for consistency.  
- Market labels anonymized; operational context inferred.  
**Future opportunities:**  
- Correlate RCR with agent tenure and resolution codes.  
- Apply text-mining on call notes to classify repeat reasons.  
- Test proactive SMS/email follow-ups vs status quo.
