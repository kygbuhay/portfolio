-- ============================================================================
-- AI Productivity ROI Analysis - Baseline Views (All Years Intersection) - CLEAN
-- Date: 2025-10-08
-- Notes:
--   - Uses cleaned tables: 2023_stackoverflow_cleaned, 2024_stackoverflow_cleaned, 2025_stackoverflow_cleaned
--   - Keeps the 27-ish shared columns seen across years (casts for consistency)
--   - Adds Region via a simple countryâ†’region mapper (TEMP FUNCTION)
--   - Creates a unified view, an exploded multi-select view, and a materialized table for Tableau
