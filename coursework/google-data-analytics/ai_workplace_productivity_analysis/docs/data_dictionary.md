## ðŸ”„ Data Processing Notes

### Data Cleaning Applied
1. **Column Name Standardization**: Spaces converted to underscores for BigQuery compatibility
2. **Currency Normalization**: All compensation converted to USD equivalents
3. **Multi-select Parsing**: Semicolon-separated values properly formatted
4. **Missing Value Handling**: Systematic approach to null values and "NA" responses

### Known Limitations
- **Self-reported Data**: Inherent bias in survey responses
- **Sample Bias**: Stack Overflow user base may not represent all developers
- **Schema Evolution**: Some questions changed between years
- **Currency Conversion**: Exchange rates may affect year-over-year comparisons

### Validation Checks
- âœ… No structural corruption detected in any dataset
- âœ… All files pass BigQuery schema validation
- âœ… Response counts match expected survey participation
- âœ… Data types properly enforced for analytics

## ðŸ“Š Usage Guidelines

### For Analysis
- **Cross-year Studies**: Use the 27 common columns for trend analysis
- **AI Impact Studies**: Focus on `AISelect` as primary adoption indicator
- **Compensation Analysis**: Use `CompTotal` with currency context
- **Technology Trends**: Leverage multi-select fields for ecosystem analysis

### For Visualization
- **Categorical Variables**: Ensure proper ordering for experience levels
- **Multi-select Fields**: Parse semicolon-separated values appropriately
- **Missing Data**: Handle null values consistently across visualizations
- **Currency Display**: Present compensation in standardized format
