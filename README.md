# Data Analytics & Business Intelligence Portfolio  

This repository contains a collection of case studies that demonstrate my skills in data analytics, business intelligence, and stakeholder communication.  
Projects are organized into two sections:  

1. **Coursework Case Studies** — Projects completed through Google/Coursera programs, polished and reframed for business impact.  
2. **Showcase Case Studies** — Independent projects (in progress) that explore real-world business problems.
