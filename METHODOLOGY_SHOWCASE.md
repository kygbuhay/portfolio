    lower, upper = series.quantile([percentile, 1-percentile])
    return series.clip(lower=lower, upper=upper)

# Domain-informed rules
domain_rules = {
    "monthly_hours": (0, 500),    # Reasonable work hour range
    "tenure_years": (0, 50),      # Career length boundaries
}
```

**Validation Excellence:**
```python
# Systematic model comparison
models = {
    'Baseline': LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced'),
    'RandomForest': RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=300),
    'XGBoost': XGBClassifier(scale_pos_weight=ratio)
}

results = []
for name, model in models.items():
    cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='roc_auc')
    results.append({
        'model': name,
        'cv_mean': cv_scores.mean(),
        'cv_std': cv_scores.std()
    })
```
